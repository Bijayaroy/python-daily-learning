# PYTHON 
## Day 1: Introduction to Python

- History of Python:
  - Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
  - Python's story begins in December 1989 when Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, started working on a new programming language during his Christmas holidays. Van Rossum's goal was to create a language that would emphasize code readability and encourage developers to write clean and expressive code.
- One of the most important changes in Python's evolution has been the addition of new libraries and frameworks. These libraries provide pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks, such as accessing databases, sending emails, and creating web applications. This has made Python even more powerful and versatile, and has helped it to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

- Basic Introduction:
  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. This means that Python code is easy for humans to read and write, and it does not need to be compiled before it can be run. Python is also interpreted, which means that it is executed one line at a time, as it is read by the interpreter. Python is a general-purpose programming language, which means that it can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, data science, machine learning, and more. Python is also a very popular language for beginners, as it is relatively easy to learn and use

## Day 2: Understanding Python Syntax
Indentation:
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. This means that all lines of code that belong to the same block must be indented at the same level.


White space:
Python uses white space to separate different elements of a code statement. This includes spaces, tabs, and newlines.


Keywords:
Keywords are special words that have a specific meaning in Python. They cannot be used as variable names.


Identifiers:
Identifiers are used to name variables, functions, classes, and other objects in Python. They must start with a letter or an underscore (_) and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.


Operators:
Operators are used to perform operations on data. They include arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and assignment operators.


Comments:
Comments are important for code readability because they make it easier for other developers to understand your code. When you write comments, you are essentially explaining your code to yourself and others. This can be helpful when you are working on a project with other people, or when you come back to your code later and need to remember what it does.
There are three different types of comments in Python:
Single-line comments: These comments start with a hash (#) and continue to the end of the line.
Multi-line comments: These comments start with a triple quote (""") and end with a triple quote.

## Day 3: Variables and Data Types

### Variables:
  - Variables are used to store and manage data in a program.
```python
age = 25
name = "John"
```
Variable naming conventions and best practices:
use lowercase with underscores for readability.
Descriptive and meaningful names enhance code clarity.
```python
user_age = 25
user_name = "John"
```
### Data Types:
  - Fundamental data types: int, float, str, bool.
int: Represents integers.
float: Represents floating-point numbers.
str: Represents strings.
bool: Represents Boolean values (True or False).

```python
age = 25 # int
height = 5.9 # float
name = "John" # str
is_adult = True # bool
```
Exploring their characteristics and use cases.
```python
x = 5 + 2.0      # Results in a float
message = "Hello, " + "world!"  # String concatenation
```

## Day 4 : Conditional Statements (if, elif, else) and Numbers, Casting, and Operators:
### (if, elif, else):
Control the flow of a program based on conditions.
```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
 print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
 print("Zero")
else:
 print("Negative")
```
### Numbers, Casting, and Operators:

- Numbers:
  - Working with integers and floats.
```python
x = 5
y = 2.0
sum_result = x + y
```

- Casting and Type Conversion:
	Changing the data type of a variable.
```python
x = 5.7
int_x = int(x)  # Casting to int, result: 5
```

  - Method for converting between data types.
	Use functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.

- Operators:
  - Exploring arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators like +, -, *, /, ==, !=, and, or, +=, etc.
Example:
```python
result = (3 + 4) * 2 # Arithmetic
is_equal = (x == y) # Comparison
```

## Day 5 : Loops (for, while):
### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(5):
 print(i)
```
### While Loop:
```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
 print(i)
 i += 1
```
### Break and Continue Statements:
Break:
```python
for i in range(10):
 if i == 5:
 break
 print(i)
```
Continue:
```python
for i in range(10):
 if i == 5:
 continue
print(i)
```
